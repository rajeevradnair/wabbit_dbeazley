This directory contains a series of tests that will help guide you
in writing the parser.   These "programs" aren't meant to execute.
They are only meant to be parsed.  They are ordered according to a
possible implementation plan for the parser.   Read each file for
additional notes that might help.

One you have finished parsing these files, move on to parsing the
programs in the tests/Programs directory.
