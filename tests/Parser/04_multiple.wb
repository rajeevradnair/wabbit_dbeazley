/* 04_multiple.wb

   Modify your parser so that it can parse multiple statements.  You'll
   need to write code that collects statements into a list of some kind.
   A tricky part of this is knowing when you're done--you might need
   to recognize a special end-of-file (EOF) token or have some other
   mechanism to stop looping and return.
