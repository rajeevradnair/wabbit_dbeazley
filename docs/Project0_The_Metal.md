# Project 0 : To the Metal

As programmers, we're all used to writing code in a high-level
language like Python, Rust, Go, etc.  However, ultimately our computer
programs have to run on a CPU--a piece of hardware.  CPUs are much
more primitive.  Really, they're often not much more than a glorified
calculator with some memory.

In the file `metal/metal.py` you will find a small simulated CPU.
Your first task is to write some small programs that run on the
CPU. Make sure you're working in your own branch of the Git repo:

```
bash $ cd compilers_2022_04
bash $ git checkout -b yourname
```

Go to the `metal/metal.py` file and follow the instructions
inside. Reminder: If you want me to be able to look at your code and
answer questions, you will need to commit your code to the repo and
push your changes upstream.

```
bash $ git push -u origin yourname
```
