# Project 2 - The Interpreter

In this project, you will build a definitional interpreter that
directly executes Wabbit from the associated
data model.  Essentially you will be able to take all of the models
you defined in `test_models.py` and make them run in some way. The
purpose of this project is to understand how programs evaluate.

Go to the file `wabbit/interp.py` and follow the instructions inside.

## Note about Functions

Implementing functions is likely to be the most difficult part of
this project.  This is because functions require you to think in more
detail about environments, scoping rules, stack frames, and other
runtime details.  This part might have to wait until later--expect
a fair bit of discussion about this.
