# Project 0.5 - SillyWabbit

The directory `SillyWabbit` has an implementation of the Wabbit
language in the form of an interpreter.  Since we are going to be
building a compiler for Wabbit, it might be useful to experiment with
the language itself.  Mainly just to try and wrap our brains around
it.

Go to the `SillyWabbit` directory and read/work on the files
`prog1.wb` through `prog5.wb`.  These programs are meant to teach you
some Wabbit basics.

You can run these programs by typing a command like this:

```
bash $ python3 wabbit.py prog1.wb
Hello
bash $
```

The `Wabbit` implementation here is not particularly robust.  If
you make a mistake, you'll likely get a rather unhelpful
error message.  That might be something you could try to do
better in your compiler.
